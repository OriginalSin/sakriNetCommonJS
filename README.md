This library contains a number of classes and Utils originally written by Sakri Rosenstrom (sakri.net, @sakri) in ActionScript3 under a net.sakri.etc pacakage.

These are mostly used in the context of programming graphics and animations.

I will now switch to first person narrative.  Oh the literary freedoms enjoyed by README.md authors.

Currently this is my backup for a number of demos I'm building for my upcoming talk at FITC Amsterdam on February 25th 2014:

http://www.sakri.net/blog/2014/01/22/talking-text-effects-with-canvas-at-fitc-amsterdam-2014/

The intention was to keep this nice and tidy, then use the classes in other projects.  However time is not on my side for FITC preparations, so it is what it is.
